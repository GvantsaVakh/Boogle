The Boggle game board is a square 
grid onto which you randomly distribute a set of letter cubes.  The goal is to find words on the board by 
tracing a path through adjoining letters.  Two letters adjoin if they are next to each other horizontally, 
vertically, or diagonally.  There are up to eight letters adjoining a cube.  Each cube can be used at most 
once in a word.  In the original version, all players work concurrently listing the words they find. 
When time is called, duplicates are removed from the lists and the players receive points for their 
remaining words.
